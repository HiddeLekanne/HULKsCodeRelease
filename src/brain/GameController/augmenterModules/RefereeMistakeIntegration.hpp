 * common referee mistakes that can easily be detected by checking the environment
 *
 * setPlay::GOAL_FREE_KICK:
 * setPlay::CORNER_KICK:
 * A common mistake is that the referee calls "GOAL FREE KICK RED" while the game controller
 * controller clicks the wrong button. See doc of the integrate*() functions for details on how we
 * attempt to detect / correct this kind of mistakes.
 *
 * unpenalize:
 * A robot is often unpenalized early while the assistant was not ready
 * (e.g. holding the robot in his hand)
