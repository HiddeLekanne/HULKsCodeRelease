/**
 * @file HULKsMessage.hpp
 *
 * This file contains information shared between HULKs robots that are not part of the
 * DevilSmashStandardMessage.
 *
 *
 * UNITS
 *
 * - Distances:     Millimeters (mm)
 * - Angles:        Radians
 * - Time:          Milliseconds (ms)
 * - Speed:         Speed (m/s)
 * - Timestamps:    Milliseconds since system/software start (ms)
 *                  Offset of timestamps are determined via NTP messages
 *
 *
 * VALUE RANGES
 *
 * The values stored in the DS message are not necessarily streamed as a whole.
 * If a value is not streamed in its natural range, a comment will indicate how the value is
 * interpreted.
 * The general comment pattern is [rangeFrom..rangeTo (precision)].
 * E.g.:
 *   /// no comment    (This will be streamed as full 4 Byte)
 *   uint32_t value0;
 *
 *   /// [2..12]    (This will be streamed with a minimum value of 2 and a maximum value of 12)
 *   uint32_t value1;
 *
 *   /// [2..12 (2)]    (This will be streamed with with a precision of 2, a minimum value of 2 and
 *       a maximum value of 12)
 *   uint32_t value2;
 *
 *   /// [delta 0..-10]    (This will be streamed in relation to the timestamp of the message in the
 *       range of 0 to -10)
 *   uint32_t time1
 *
 *   /// [delta 0..-10 (64ms)] timestamp (This will be streamed in relation to the
 *       timestamp of the message in the range of 0 to -10, unit of the values is 64ms
 *   uint32_t time1
